There is a setuid binary "bonus2" own by bonus3

After disassembling the binary we can see that main() function use the LANG environment variable
which would be important for the bug to be used

The program take 2 arguments, which are truncated to 40 and 32 bytes respectively and stored in str1 and str2

the isn't a bounds checking on str1, so it can be non-null-terminated
and therefor appear as str1 and str2 combined so a 72 Bytes buffer

the LANG env variable can be either "fi", "nl" or another value

After we test different value for LANG variable
we observe that we can overflow enought the text buffer to change return address with the strcat() in greetuser()
when LANG == "fi"

then we do a ret2libc, as seen in previous levels
[ data to overflow ] [ system() address ] [ return address ] [ "/bin/sh" address from libc ]
