There is a setuid binary "bonus3" own by end

After disassembling the binary we can see that main() function call execl() on "/bin/sh"
only if it assert `strcmp(passwd, argv[1]) == 0`

so we need to make passwd and argv[1] the same to get a shell

passwd buffer is feed from "/home/user/end/.pass" file
and then truncated to `atoi(argv[1])` number of characters

Here we use the fact that atoi return 0 when called with a empty string

passwd will get truncated to a 0 length string
which will obviously match with the empty string of argv[1]
