There is a setuid binary "level0" own by level1

After disassembling the binary we can see that main() function call execv() with "/bin/sh"
only if it assert atoi(argv[1]) == 423

so we just need to pass "423" to first argument

level0@RainFall:~$> ./level0 423

level1@RainFall:~$> cat ~level1/.pass
